{
Over 90\% of most categories' domains rely on external resources -- external resources are considered trackers (\ref{sec:Internal-versus-external})
}	{
Uses more external resources than .dk, but less than .com and .net (\ref{sec:Internal-versus-external})
}	{
There are at least as many external resources, meaning as much tracking, on secure as insecure top domains (alexa.top.10k-hw and alexa.top.10k-sw in Figure \ref{fig:Result-selection-internal-secure-organizations}(a))
}
{
% A
}	{
39\% use \emph{only} external resources (se.r.100k-hw in Figure \ref{fig:Result-selection-internal-external-insecure-tracker-categories-top-organizations}(a))
}	{
94\% of \numprint{5959} HTTPS-www variation domains call external domains (\ref{sec:Domain-and-request-counts})
}
{
% A
}	{
Many random domains use only external resources due to being parked (\ref{sec:Results-Internal-and-external-requests}) or redirecting away from the origin domain (\ref{sec:HTTP,-HTTPS-and-redirects})
}	{
78\% of \numprint{123000} HTTP-www variation domains call external domains (\ref{sec:Domain-and-request-counts})
}
{}	{\centering\textbf{Secure vs insecure}}	{}
{
Only 13 of 290 municipalities have fully secure websites; no Swedish media sites are completely secure (\ref{sec:Insecure-versus-secure-resources})
}	{
Only 0.3\% respond to secure requests, in line with .dk and .net, while .com has 0.5-0.6\% response rate (\ref{sec:Failed-versus-non-failed})
}	{
% C
}
{
25\% of Swedish municipalities responding to secure requests load 90\% of their resources securely -- it's close, but still considered insecure (se.hs.municip-sw in Figure \ref{fig:Result-selection-internal-secure-organizations}(b))
}	{

}	{

{
Financial institutions redirect from secure \emph{to insecure} sites for 20\% of responding domains (\ref{sec:HTTP,-HTTPS-and-redirects})

{}	{\centering\textbf{Known trackers}}	{}
{
A single visit to each media sites would leak information to at least 57 organizations (\ref{sub:Domain-and-organization-counts})
}	{
Disconnect \emph{only detects 3\%} of external primary domains as trackers (\ref{sub:Tracker-detection-effectiveness})
}	{
A few global top domains load more than 75 known trackers on their front page alone (\ref{sub:Domain-and-organization-counts})
}
{
70\% use content from known trackers (\ref{sub:Disconnect-categories-coverage})
}	{
58\% use content from known trackers (\ref{sub:Disconnect-categories-coverage})
}	{
Disconnect's blocking list \emph{only detects 10\%} of external primary domains as trackers for top website datasets (\ref{sub:Tracker-detection-effectiveness})
}

}	{
Over 40\% use Google Analytics or Google API (\ref{sub:Top-domains-Google})

{
Swedish media seems very social, with the highest Twitter and Facebook coverage (\ref{sub:Top-organizations})
}	{

Twitter has about half the coverage of Facebook (\ref{sub:Top-organizations})

50\% of top sites always redirect to the www subdomain, 13\% always redirect to their primary domain (\ref{sec:HTTP,-HTTPS-and-redirects})
