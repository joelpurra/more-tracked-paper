\begin_layout Abstract
When you are browsing websites, third-party resources record your online
 habits; such 
\emph on
tracking
\emph default
 can be considered an invasion of privacy.
 It was previously unknown how many third-party resources, trackers and
 tracker companies are present in the different classes of websites chosen:
 globally popular websites, random samples of .se/.dk/.com/.net domains and
 curated lists of websites of public interest in Sweden.
 The in-browser HTTP/HTTPS traffic was recorded while downloading over 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
numprint{150000}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 websites, allowing comparison of HTTPS adaption and third-party tracking
 within and across the different classes of websites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The data shows that known third-party resources including known trackers
 are present on over 70% 
\begin_inset Note Greyedout
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
70-93%
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of sites, that third-party hosted 
\emph on
content
\emph default
 such as video, scripts and fonts make up a large portion of the known trackers
 seen on a typical website and that tracking is as prevalent on secure as
 insecure sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The observation that content is being served by known trackers may suggest
 that trackers are moving to providing services to the end user to avoid
 being blocked by privacy tools and ad blockers, while the observation that
 there is little difference in tracking between using HTTP and HTTPS connections
 may suggest that users are given a false sense of privacy when using HTTPS.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How many companies are recording your online trail, and how much information
 does the average Swede leak while using popular .se websites? Many, and
 a lot -- more than you may think.
 Large organizations like Google, Facebook and Amazon are able to connect
 the dots you leave behind during everyday usage, and construct a 
\emph on
persona
\emph default
 that reflects you from their perspective.
 Have you told your family, friends or colleagues about your gambling addiction,
 your sex toy purchases, or your alcoholism? Even if you did not tell anyone
 your deepest secrets, these companies might conclude that they can put
 labels on you by looking at everything you do online.
 And now they are selling it as hard facts behind the scenes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While browsing the web users are both actively and passively being 
\emph on
tracked
\emph default
 by multiple companies, for the purpose of building a persona for targeted
 advertising.
 Sometimes the data collection is visible, as in social network sites and
 questionnaires, but it is most common in the form of different kinds of
 external resources which may or may not serve a purpose other than keeping
 track of your every click.
 Secure connections between server and client help against passive data
 collection along the network path, but not against site owners allowing
 in-page trackers.
 Tracking code is installed on web pages that have adverts as well as those
 that do not -- the spread and reach of tracking across web pages and domains
 of different kinds increases the quality of the user data collected and
 inferred, making it more valuable for advertising purposes.
 With the extent of the use of trackers and other external resources largely
 unknown and ever evolving, what is already known raises privacy concerns
 -- data considered personal leak without the user's knowledge or explicit
 permission and end up in privately owned databases for further distribution.
 Data collection is the new wild west, and you are the new cattle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis uses large-scale measurements to characterize how different
 kinds of domains in Sweden and internationally use website resources.
 Front pages of approximately 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
numprint{150000}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 random .se, .dk, .com, .net domains and Swedish, Danish and Alexa's top domains
 were visited and their resources, including those dynamically loaded, recorded.
 Each domain was accessed both with insecure HTTP and secure HTTPS connections
 to provide a comparison.
 Resources were grouped by mime type, URL protocol, domain, if it matches
 the domain the request originated from and compared to lists of known trackers
 and organizations.
 The thesis makes three primary contributions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Software for automated, repeatable retrieval and analysis of large amounts
 of websites has been developed, and released as open source (see Appendix
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "chap:Software"

\end_inset

).
 Datasets based on publicly available domain lists have been released for
 scientific scrutinization

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://joelpurra.com/projects/masters-thesis/"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The data allows analysis of websites' HTTP/HTTPS requests including the
 use of resources internal versus external to the entry domain, which the
 most common confirmed tracker organizations are, what spread they have
 and how much the average internet user can expect to be tracked by visiting
 some of the most important and popular sites in Sweden, Denmark and worldwide.
 Downloading and analyzing additional/custom datasets is very easy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Adaption of HTTPS for different domains has been characterized from a Swedish
 perspective.
 The adaption between classes of domains within Sweden, as well as against
 popular international domains, are compared (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Results-HTTP,-HTTPS-and-redirects"

\end_inset

).
 HTTPS adoption among globally popular websites (10-30%, 50% for the very
 top) and curated lists of Swedish websites (15-50%) is much higher than
 for random domains (less than 1%).
 This means that most websites in the world are susceptible to passive eavesdrop
ping anywhere along the network path between the client and the server.
 But even with HTTPS enabled, traffic data and personally identifiable informati
on is leaked through external resources and third-party trackers, which
 are just as prevalent on insecure HTTP as secure HTTPS enabled websites
 (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Results-Internal-and-external-requests"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Results-Trackers-and-tracker-organizations"

\end_inset

).
 This means that a secure, encrypted connection protecting against eavesdropping
 doesn't automatically lead to 
\emph on
privacy
\emph default
 -- something which users might be lead to believe when it is called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

secure connection
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as well as through the use of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

security symbols
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 such as padlocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The use of known, confirmed third-party trackers and other third-party services
 for different classes of domains, has been analyzed.
 Using public lists of potential tracker domains, we analyzed and compared
 the wide spread adaption of these services across domains within Sweden,
 as well as internationally.
 The use of external resources is high among all classes of domains (see
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Results-Internal-and-external-requests"

\end_inset

).
 Web sites using strictly internal resources are less than 7% of top sites,
 even less in most categories of curated lists of Swedish websites, while
 it is more common among random domains at 10-30%.
 This means most web sites around the world have made an active choice to
 install external resources from third-party services, which means that
 users' traffic data and personal information is leaked (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Results-Trackers-and-tracker-organizations"

\end_inset

).
 Most websites also have at least one known tracker present; 53-72% of random
 domains have at least one tracker installed, while 88-98% of top websites
 have trackers and 78-100% of websites in the Swedish curated lists.
 The number of known tracker organizations is interesting to look at, as
 a higher number means users have less control over where leaked data ends
 up.
 Around 55% of random Swedish domains have 1-3 trackers, and about 5% have
 more than 3.
 Nearly 50% of global top sites load resources from 3 or more tracker organizati
ons, while about 5% load from more than 20 organizations.
 Half of the Swedish media websites load more than 6 known trackers; a single
 visit to the front page of each of the 27 investigated sites would leak
 information in over

 to at least 57 organizations

.
 This means that any guesswork in what types of articles individuals read
 would read in a printed newspaper is gone -- and with that probably the
 guesswork in exactly what kind of opinions these individuals hold.

Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In everyday web browsing, browsers routinely access a lot of material from
 other domains or services than the one visited 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Feldmann:2004:MEI:1028788.1028833"

\end_inset

.
 These external resources vary from content that the user explicitly want
 to obtain, to implicitly loaded third-party services, ads, and non-visible
 resources with the sole purpose of collecting user data and statistical
 material 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Krishnamurthy:2006:CMC:1135777.1135829"

\end_inset

.
 All are downloaded on behalf of the user with no or few limitations, and
 oftentimes without the user's need, understanding and explicit consent.
 These external resources can all be seen as browsing habit trackers, whose
 knowledge and power increase with any additional visits to other domains
 or services loading the same resources 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Malandrino:2013:PAI:2517840.2517868"

\end_inset

.
 While privacy is both hard to define as well as relative to perspective
 and context, there is a correlation between trackers and online privacy;
 more trackers means it becomes harder to control the flow of personal informati
on and get an overview of where data ends up

\begin_layout Standard
While online privacy has been in the spotlight due to recently uncovered
 mass surveillance operations, the focus has been on national government
 intelligence agencies collecting information around the globe.
 Public worry regarding surveillance in Sweden is low.
 Only 9% of adult Swedish internet users say they worry to some degree about
 government surveillance, but at 20% twice as many worry about companies'
 surveillance -- a number that has been steadily rising from 11% in 2011
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ahlgren:2014aa,Findahl:2014aa"

\end_inset

.
 Governments are able to intercept traffic data and metadata by, among several
 techniques, 
\emph on
covertly
\emph default
 hooking into the internet infrastructure and passively listening.
 Basic connection metadata can always be collected, but without secure connectio
ns between client and server, any detail in the contents of each request
 can be extracted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, external resources are approved by and actively installed by
 site and service owners, and presented openly to users with basic technical
 skills and tools.
 Reasons can be technical, for example because distributing resources among
 systems improves performance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Krishnamurthy:2006:CMC:1135777.1135829,Krishnamurthy:2000:AFI:347319.346248"

\end_inset

.
 Other times it is because there are positive network effects in using a
 third-party online social network (OSN) to promote content and products.
 Ads are installed as a source of income.
 More and more commonly, allowing a non-visible tracker to be installed
 can also become a source of income -- data aggregation companies pay for
 access to users' data on the right site with the right quantity and quality
 of visitors.
 Because these external resources are used on behalf of the service, they
 are also loaded when end-to-end encryption with HTTPS is enabled for enhanced
 privacy and security.
 This encryption bypass gives these private trackers more information than
 possible with large-scale passive traffic interception, even when there
 is a security nullifying mixture of encrypted and unencrypted connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What is known by trackers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Depending on what activities a user performs online, different things can
 be inferred by trackers on sites where they are installed.
 For example, a tracker on a news site can draw conclusions about interests
 from content a user reads (or choses 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 to) by tagging articles with refined keywords and creating an interest
 graph 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kumar:2013:GBT:2522548.2523129"

\end_inset

.
 The range of taggable interests of course depend on the content of the
 news site.
 Private and sensitive information leaked to third-party sites during typical
 interaction with some of the most popular sites in the world include personal
 identification (full name, date of birth, email, ip address, geolocation)
 and sensitive information (sexual orientation, religious beliefs, health
 issues)

Social buttons, allowing users to share links with a simple click, are tracking
 users whether they are registered or not, logged in or not 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 They are especially powerful when the user is registered and logged in,
 combining the full self-provided details of the user with their browsing
 habits -- all within the bounds of the services' privacy policies agreed
 to by the user.
 Once a user has provided their personal information, it is no longer just
 the individual browser or device being tracked, but the actual 
\emph on
person
\emph default
 using it -- even after logging out

 This direct association, as opposed to inferred, to the person also allows
 for tracking across devices where there is an overlap of services used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What is the information used for?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Publishers reserve areas of their web pages for displaying different kinds
 and sizes of advertisements alongside content.
 Ads chosen for the site may be aligned with the content but it is more
 valuable the more is known about the visitors.
 Combining and aggregating information from past visitors means that more
 information can be assumed about future visitors, on a statistical basis,
 which will define the general audience of the site.
 To generate even more revenue per displayed ad, individual users are

 While the effects of a web-wide user tracking have not been broadly measured

 One company offers lists of "Underbanked Prime Prospects" broken down by

High level overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on a list of domains, the front page of each domain is downloaded
 and parsed the way a user's browser would.
 The URL of each requested resource is extracted, and associated with the
 domain it was loaded from.
 This data is then classified in a number of ways, before being boiled down
 to statistics about the entire dataset.
 Lastly, these aggregates are compared between datasets.
 In the following sections we describe each of these steps in more detail.
 For yet more details of the methodology, we refer to Appendix

One assumption is that all resources external to the initially requested

 We see that 47% (459 of 980) have at least two domains listed by Disconnect.me.
 Google (rightmost point) alone has 271 domains and Yahoo has 71.
 Some organizations have their domains categorized in more than one category,
 as shown in detail in Table

 Due to the relaxed blocking of the content category this can provide a
 way to track users despite being labeled a tracker organization.

In order to make comparisons between insecure HTTP and secure HTTPS, domains
 have been accessed using both protocols.
 As websites traditionally have been hosted on the www subdomain, not all
 domains have been configured to respond to HTTP requests to the primary
 domain -- thus both the added www prefix and no added prefix have been
 accessed.
 This means four variations for each domain in the domain lists, quadrupling
 the number of accesses

 It uses the command line JSON processor jq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 to transform the JSON-based HAR data to formats tailored to analyze specific
 parts of each domain and their HTTP requests/responses.

Data extracted includes URL, HTTP status, mime-type, referer and redirect
 values -- both for the origin domain's front page and any resources requests
 by it 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sub:Extracting-HAR-format-parts"

\end_inset

.
 Each piece of data is then expanded, to simplify further classification
 and extraction of individual bits of information; URLs are split into component
s such as scheme (protocol) and host (domain), the status is labeled by
 status group and the mime-type split into type and encoding

\begin_layout Standard
Once data has been extracted and expanded, there are three classification
 steps.
 The first loads the public suffix list and matches domains against it,
 in order to separate the FQDN into public suffixes, private prefixes and
 extract the primary domain 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sub:Public-Suffix-List-classification"

\end_inset

.
 The primary domain, which is the first non-public suffix match, or the
 shortest private suffix, is used as one of the basic classifications; is
 an HTTP request made to a domain with the same primary domain as the origin
 domain's primary domain? Other basic classifications 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sub:Basic-classification"

\end_inset

 compare the origin domain with each requested resource's URL, to see if
 they are made to the same domain, a subdomain or a superdomain.
 Same domain, subdomain, superdomain and same primary domain requests often
 overlap in their classification -- collectively they are called internal
 requests.
 Any request not considered an internal request is an external request --
 which is one of the fundamental ideas behind the thesis' result grouping
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Internal-versus-external"

\end_inset

.
 Mime-types are counted and grouped, to show differences in resource usage
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Content-type-group-coverage"

\end_inset

.
 To get an overview of domain groups, their primary domains and public suffixes
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Public-suffix-coverage"

\end_inset

 are also kept.
 Another fundamental distinction is also wether a request is secure -- using
 the HTTPS protocol -- or insecure.
 Finally, Disconnect's blocking list 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Capturing-tracker-requests"

\end_inset

 is mixed in, to be able to potentially classify each requests' domain as
 a known tracker 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sub:Disconnect.me-classification"

\end_inset

After classification has completed, numbers are collected across the dataset's
 domains 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Counts are summed up per domain 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Request-counts"

\end_inset

, but also reduced to boolean values indicating if a request matches a certain
 classification property or primary/tracker domain, so that a single domain
 making an excessive number of requests would not skew numbers aggregated
 across domains.
 This allows domain coverage calculations, meaning on what proportion of
 domains a certain value is present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the results presented in the thesis report are based on non-failed
 origin domains.
 Non-failed means that the initial HTTP request to the domain's front page
 returned a proper HTTP status code, even if it was not indicative of a
 complete success 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Failed-versus-non-failed"

\end_inset

.
 Subsequent requests made while loading the front pages were grouped into
 unfiltered, only internal and only external requests 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Internal-versus-external"

\end_inset

 The analysis is therefore split into six versions

 While others have spidered entire websites from the root to find, for example,
 a specific group of external services

 The front page is assumed to contain many, if not most, of the different
 types used on a domain.
 Analysis has mostly been performed on each predefined domain list as a
 whole, but dynamic -- and perhaps iterative -- re-grouping of domain based
 on results could improve accuracy, understanding and crystallize details.
 It would also be of interest to build a graph of domains and interconnected
 services, to visualize potential information sharing between them

\begin_layout Standard
With each request classified as either internal or external to the originating
 domain, it is easy to see how sites divide their resources 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Internal-versus-external"

\end_inset

.
 Less than 10% of top sites use strictly internal resources, meaning up
 to 93% of top sites are composed using at least a portion of external resources.
 See the percentage of domains (x axis) using strictly internal, mixed and
 strictly external resources in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Result-selection-internal-external-insecure-tracker-categories-top-organizations"

\end_inset

a for a selection of datasets, and Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:internal-mixed-external-resources"

\end_inset

 for all datasets.
 This means external resources -- in this thesis seen as trackers -- have
 actively been installed, be it as a commercial choice or for technical
 reasons 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Trackers-are-a-commercial-choice"

\end_inset

.
 The difference between HTTP and HTTPS datasets is generally small, showing
 that users are as tracked on insecure as on secure sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Result-selection-internal-secure-organizations"

\end_inset

a shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the ratio of external
 resources used by each domain, with 0% and 99% internal resources marked.
 In particular, we show the ratio of domains (y axis) as a function of the
 ratio of internal resources seen by each domain (x axis).
 This maps to the bar graph in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Result-selection-internal-external-insecure-tracker-categories-top-organizations"

\end_inset

a; 0% is all external, over 99% is all internal -- in between means mixed
 security.
 Similar to the HTTPS adaption, we observe significant differences between
 randomly selected domains and the most popular (top ranked) domains.
 See how dataset HTTP/HTTPS variation lines follow each other for most datasets,
 again pointing towards 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 HTTPS serving as many trackers as insecure HTTP.
 This means that a secure, encrypted connection protecting against eavesdropping
 doesn't automatically lead to 
\emph on

\emph default
 -- something which users might be lead to believe when it is called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as well as through the use of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

security symbols
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 such as padlocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the HTTP variation of random .se domains 40% use strictly external resources;
 this seems to be connected with the fact that many domains are

 and load all their resources from an external domain which serves the domain
 name retailer's resources for all parked domains.
 The same domains seem to not have HTTPS enabled, as can be seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Result-selection-http-codes-redirects-secure"

\end_inset

a, and the remaining HTTPS domains show the same internal resource ratio
 characteristics as top domains.
 There is a wide variety of parked page styles, as well as other front pages
 without actual content, but they have not yet been fully investigated and
 separately analyzed

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sites which implement HTTPS sometimes take advantage of redirects to direct
 the user from an insecure to a secure connection, for example when the
 user didn't type in 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 into the browser's address bar.
 Surprisingly, this is not very common -- while many redirect to a preferred
 variant of their domain name, usually the www subdomain, only a few percent
 elect to redirect to a secure URL 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The average number of redirects for domains with redirects is

b as ratio of domains (x axis) which are strictly secure, have mixed HTTP/HTTPS
 redirects, are strictly insecure or which could not be determined because
 of URL verification mismatches.
 It is shown that redirects more often point to insecure than secure URLs
 -- even if the origin request was made to a secure URL.
 The secure random .se domains have a higher secure redirect ratio, but due
 to the very low response rate of 0.3% when using HTTPS -- and even fewer
 with redirects -- it is hard to draw solid conclusions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems that Swedish media shun secure connections -- none of them present
 a fully secured domain, serving mixed content in case of responding to
 secure requests.
 At the same time, they use the highest count of both internal and external
 resources -- with numbers several times higher than other domain lists
 -- and more than 20% of requests go to known trackers.

\begin_layout Standard
While looking at the number of requests made to trackers can give a hint
 towards how much tracking is installed on a website, but it can be argued
 that one or two carefully composed requests can contain the same information
 as several request.
 The difference is merely technical, as not all types of resources can be
 efficiently bundled and transferred in a single requests, but require more
 than one -- therefore it's more interesting to look at the number of organizati
ons which resources are loaded from

The CDF of the ratio of domains (y axis) with the number of organizations

c.
 The random .se domain HTTPS variation has a different characteristic than
 others, with 40% of domains having no detected third party organizations;
 it can be due to the very low response rate for that particular variation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Failed-versus-non-failed"

\end_inset

; around 55% of random Swedish HTTP domains have 1-3 trackers, and about
 5% have more than 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can again be seen that the amount of tracking is the same in other HTTP-www
 variations as in their respective HTTPS-www variation -- the figure shows
 that the lines follow each other.
 Most websites also have at least one known tracker present; 53-72% of random
 domains have at least one tracker installed, while 88-98% of top websites
 have trackers and 78-100% of websites in the Swedish curated lists.
 In the larger Alexa global top

 dataset, 70% of sites allow more than one external organization, 10% allow
 13 or more and 1% even allow more than 48 trackers -- and that is looking
 only on the front page of the domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Out of the Swedish media domains, 50% share information with more than seven
 tracker organizations -- and one of them is sharing information with 38
 organizations.
 Half of the Swedish media websites load more than 6 known trackers; a single
 visit to the front page of each of the 27 investigated sites would leak
 information in over

 This means that any guesswork in what types of articles individuals read
 would read in a printed newspaper is gone -- and with that probably the
 guesswork in exactly what kind of opinions these individuals hold.
 While it is already known that commercial media outlets makes their money
 through advertising, this level of tracking might be surprising -- it seems
 to indicate that what news users read online is very well known.
 It could also mean that this type of intimate knowledge of what news is
 popular connected with the kind of click traffic advertisers are seeing
 means that they have financial incentive to control exactly what the media
 writes.
 Does bad news bring more clicks than good? Write more about bad news.
 Advertisers could also expand article categorization with fine-grained
 details and connect article reading to visits on other sites to improve
 click-through rates.

 The organization with the most spread, by far, is Google.

 Google is very popular with all top domains and most Swedish curated datasets
 have a coverage above 80% -- and many closer to 90%.
 Random domains have a lower reliance on Google at 47-62% -- still about
 half of all domains.
 Apart from the .SE Health Status list of Swedish media domains, Facebook
 doesn't reach 40% in top or curated domains.
 Facebook coverage on random zone domains is 6-10%, which is also much lower
 than Google's numbers.
 Twitter generally has even lower coverage, at about half of that of Facebook
 on average.
 As can be seen, Google alone oftentimes has a coverage higher than the
 domains in the Disconnect category -- it shows that Google's content domains

One of the reasons this thesis subject was chosen was the inclusion of a

 The highest coverage category (government owned corporations) is even above

 Since Google Analytics can now be used from the DoubleClick domain as well
 as Google offering several other services, looking only at the Google Analytics
 domain makes little sense -- instead it might make more sense to look at
 the organization Google as a whole.
 The coverage jumps quite a bit, with most categories landing above 85%

 The reports are a bit unclear about some numbers as measurement methodology
 and focus has shifted over the years, but the general results seem to line
 up with the results in this thesis.
 Quality of the HTTPS certificate is also considered by looking at for example

 Measurements changed in 2009, so they might not be fully comparable.
 No HTTPS measurements were performed in 2012.

 uses a similar approach to detecting trackers -- or in their case advertisement
s -- as in this thesis, using the Firefox browser plugin AdBlock as the
 base for their blocking model.
 The ad blocking list Filterset.G from 2005-10-10 contains 108 domains as
 well as from 55 regular expressions.
 Matching was done after collecting requested URLs using a local proxy server,
 which means that HTTPS requests were lost.

 -- the way Disconnect does it -- might lead to fewer detected trackers,
 as the paper shows that only 38% of their ad matches were domain matches,
 plus 10% which matched both domain and path rules.
 Their matching found 872 unique servers from 108 domain rules -- the

 some of the economical motivations behind tracking users across the web

 Using HTTP traffic recorded from different networks, the paper looks at
 the presence of different 
\emph on

 of content.
 To distinguish publishers from aggregators, the domains in each session
 are grouped with regards to the originating request's domain's IP-address'
 network autonomous system (AS) number -- requests to another AS number
 are counted as third parties/aggregators.
 In some cases looking at AS numbers leads to confusion, for example when
 multiple publishers are hosted on CDN service; separating publishers and
 aggregators by domain names is then used.

 It looks like the paper has grouped AdMob under Global Crossing, which
 was a large network provider connecting 70 countries before being acquired

 AdMob was acquired by Google already in 2009, so it's unclear why it's
 listed separately; one reason might be because the dataset is mobile-centric
 and that AS number is still labeled Global Crossing.

One of the prerequisites for the type of analysis performed in this thesis
 was that all collection should be automated, repeatable and be able to
 handle tens of thousands of domains at a time.
 This goal has been achieved, and a specialized framework for analyzing
 web pages's HTTP requests has been built.
 While most of the code has been tailored to answer questions posed in this
 thesis, it is also built to be extendable, both in and between all data
 processing steps.
 More data can be included, additional datasets can be mixed in, separate
 questions can be written to query data from any stage in the data preparation
 or analysis.
 Tools have been written to easily download and compare separate lists of
 domains, and by default data is kept in its original downloaded form so
 that historical analysis can be performed.

 Fortunately, the code is easy to run, and with proper documentation other
 groups should be able to at least test simple theories regarding websites.
 Some of the lists of domains used as input are publicly available, and
 thus results can also be shared.
 This should encourage other groups, as looking at example data might spark
 interest.

\begin_layout Standard
One such suggestion might be to add an absolute/resolved version of

 As subsequent HTTP requests are hard to refer to without relying either
 on exact request ordering (the executed redirect always coming exactly
 as the next entry) or at least having the URL resolved (preferably by the
 browser) before writing it to the HAR data.

 to resolve relative URLs using a separate javascript library have proven
 inexact when it comes to matching against the browser's executed URL, differing
 for example in wether trailing slashes are kept for domain root requests
 or not.
 What would be even better, is a way to refer to the reason for the HTTP
 request, be it an HTML tag, a script call or an HTTP redirect -- but that
 could to be highly implementation dependent per browser.

 Since it is only an example from their side, a more developed version might

Disconnect relies heavily on their blocking list

 the blocking list, a number of errors and inconsistencies were found.
 Unfortunately, the maintainers do not seem very active in the project,
 and even trivial data encoding errors were not patched over a month after
 submission.
 According to Disconnect's Eason Goodale in an email conversation 2014-08-13,
 the team has been concentrating on a second version of Disconnect as well
 as other projects.
 While patches can be submitted through Disconnect's Github project pages,
 Goodale's reply seems to indicate they will not be accepted in a timely

 shows that identifying ads and how data collected from trackers affect
 ads has several challenges.
 This thesis does not look at 
\emph on
which
\emph default
 ads are shown to a user, but rather where ads are served from.
 Potentially relevant to this thesis would be for example DNS load-balancing
 by ad networks, cookies differing between browser instances and local proxies
 affecting the HTTP request.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Final dataset downloads were performed by a single machine 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 so there should not be any proxy partially affecting the results 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Load-balancing such as using multiple (round-robin) DNS records might lead
 to varying results, depending on the remote system setup.
 Browser instances themselves are short-lived and share the same system-level
 DNS cache, so requests made within the DNS records' time to live (TTL)
 should act, and thus vary, uniformly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cookies might affect which ad network is used by an ad network aggregator;
 in this case each request is made by a new browser instance without any
 cookies, so results should be random -- at least from the client-side point
 of view 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 As domains/websites are not reloaded, but rather requested four separate

 It was shown that unique user identifiers were shared between different
 third parties.
 IDs can be shared in different ways.
 If both third parties exist on the same page, they can be shared through
 scripts or by looking for any IDs in the location URL.
 They can also be shared by one third-party sending requests to a second
 third-party (a fourth-party?

 They also showed that a user's browsing history reconstruction rate rose

\begin_layout Standard
The study used a modified Firefox browser to look at values stored in primarily
 cookies.
 As all HTTP requests are recorded in this thesis, including HTTP cookie
 headers, a limited version of the same study could be performed.
 In addition, they look at in-browser scripting utilizing for example

 While that might be possible, the modifications that would need to be made
 to phantomjs are non-trivial, and my current scope does not allow for that.
 With their research as a base, cookie respawning and sharing could possibly
 be confirmed using this thesis' code as a external tool using a different
 browser platform.

Despite thesis code being open source, much of the thesis data is hard to

 A separate tool performing the work for anyone should be created.
 Apart from presenting data already collected as a part of the thesis, it
 could accept user input to analyze individual domains.
 With several domains as input, any overlap can be detected and presented
 to the user as an information sharing graph.
 One of the inspirations for this thesis was Collusion

, which is a tool to dynamically display from which external domains a page
 retrieves resources right in the browser.
 A version of the same tool could be built, where instead of letting the
 user's browser retrieve sites the server would do it.
 This way a non-technical user does not have to

risk

 anything by visiting web pages, and their relationship could be displayed
 anyways.
 Collecting data server-side also allows for cached lookups and a grander
 scope, where further relationships apart from the first hand ones could
 be suggested.

Package publicly available data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Datasets based on publicly available datasets can be packaged for other
 researchers to analyze.
 While fresh data would be better, a larger dataset can take time to download
 on a slow connection or computer and all software may not be available
 to the researcher.
 It lowers the step in for others who might be interested in the same kind
 of research, which might lead to the software used in this thesis being
 improved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Code documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With some 75 scripts written and released as open source, the need for documenta
tion has gradually increased.
 The reason for not writing proper documentation -- not having direct collaborat
ors writing code -- is a hinderance for future collaborators or users to
 get started.
 While code documentation has not been an explicit part of the thesis plan,
 it can be seen as an important step for future usage.
 The code is not magic in any way, but if understanding the functionality
 of a file required reading over a hundred lines of code instead of two
 or three lines of comments, it means a rather steep learning curve for
 something that is supposed to be simple.

\begin_layout Subsection
Automated testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far all testing of har-heedless and phantomjs has been done manually.
 It has proven to be a working setup, as thesis results are based on these
 tools, but the features are to be considered fragile as there are no regression
 tests.
 Automated tests of the different levels (shell scripts,

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, screenshots, error handling) might help achieve stability in case of for
 example future improvements of phantomjs.
 Tests might include setting up a web server with test pages serving different
 kinds of content, as well as different kinds of errors.
 During mass downloading of domains phantomjs has been observed outputting
 error messages, such as failed JPEG image decoding and unspecified crashes.
 The extent of these errors have so far not been examined, as they have
 ended up being clumped together with external errors such as network or
 remote server failures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Investigating failed domains
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many reasons domain retrieval could fail, but for top or curated
 domain lists the chances of the site being down are considerably lower
 than for randomly selected domains.
 Each website has been requested up to three times, in order to avoid intermitte
nt problems 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Failed-domains"

\end_inset

.
 Despite this, certain sites do not respond to requests from the automated
 software.
 There are several ways for a remote system to detect requests from automation
 software, with the simplest one being looking at the HTTP 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
User-Agent
\end_layout

\end_inset

 browser make/model identifier string.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Automated downloading of webpages, especially downloading several in short
 succession, can be seen by site and service owners as disruptive by using
 system resources and skewing statistical data.
 Traversing different pages on a single website can also be detected by
 looking at for example navigational patterns 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tan:2002:DWR:593432.593521,Lourenco:2006:CWC:1145581.1145634"

\end_inset

.
 By only downloading the domain root page and associated resources this
 tool might not fall into that category of detection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As some sites respond to desktop browser requests, but not har-heedless'
 requests, it is believed they have implemented certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

protection
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from this kind of software.
 In respect of their wish not to serve automated requests, har-heedless'
 browser has not been modified, for example by using a different 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 string, to try to avoid these measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Browser plugins
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If possible, a set of common browser plugins could be installed into phantomjs.
 The first that comes into mind is Adobe Flash, which is sometimes used
 to display dynamic ads.
 Flash also has the ability to request resources from other domains, so
 it might affect results to not render them.
 An additional problem might be that Flash has its own cookie system, which
 used storage external to the browser.
 This brings a new set of potential problems, as Flash cookies are a big
 part of evercookies and cookie respawning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Acar:2014:WNF:2660267.2660347"

\end_inset

.
 This means that a headless browser without persistent storage might end
 up having identifier cookies set in Flash storage, thus being easily and
 uniquely identified on subsequent visits.
 While this might not affect this thesis much, as external plugins have
 not been installed, it might affect other kinds of research being conducted
 based on the same tools.

 While sites have been downloaded from around the world, localized domains
 might behave differently depending on user language.
 Google has a recommendation saying that they will prioritize TLDs specific
 to a region with a certain language (such as .se and Sweden) for users sending

 rate.

System fonts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the difference between site screenshots and manually browsing to
 a site is in the fonts displayed.
 Most of the domains have been downloaded on a headless server, where fonts
 have not mattered to the system owner.
 Installing additional fonts commonly available on average user systems
 might reduce perceived difference.

, which exists in several varieties -- privacy blocking, country specific,
 social media content blocking and others.
 They were considered, but in the end not incorporated because of the filter
 list format.
 It is a mixture of HTML element and URL blocking, and it lacks the connection
 between blocks and corresponding organization

\begin_layout Standard
On a technical level, some blocking rule formats have also posed a problem
 in terms of implementation into the current data processing framework that
 is har-dulcify.
 It relies heavily on jq (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:jq"

\end_inset

), which does not have a public release that implements in regular expressions
 support, a major part of some blocking lists.
 The idea is that ads and related resources are filtered matching requests'
 complete URL against the blocking rules, which are a mixture of both more
 coarse and more fine-grained than Disconnect's domain based rules.
 One example is 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
/ads/
\end_layout

\end_inset

, matching a folder name that suggests that all URLs containing this particular
 path substring is serving advertisements.
 The thought of using a single path substring to block advertisements served
 from any domain is more coarse than pinpointing a single domain, but it
 is also more specific as it would not block legitimate content from another
 subfolder on the same domain.
 This way general ad serving systems can be blocked, while domains that
 serve both ads and content is still allowed serve the content without interferi
ng with the blocking of ads.

Improving data analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Improvements to the data transformation and analysis steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Automated testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data transformations have been written in a semi-structured manner, with
 separate files for most separate tasks, often executed in serial stages.
 Each task accepts a certain kind of data as input for the transformation
 to work correctly -- but as both input and output from separate stages
 looks very similar, it is hard to tell which kind of data it accepts and
 what the expected output is -- and if a change in one stage will affect
 later stages.
 Writing automated tests for each stage would have helped during both adding
 functionality and refactoring the structure.
 At times, there have been rather time-consuming problems with unexpected
 or illegal input from real world sites -- extracting that kind of input
 to create a test suite would have sped up fixes and raised confidence in
 that the input would be handled appropriately and output would still be
 correct.
 So far that has not been done, and much of the opportunity to gain from
 tests have been lost as work has progressed past each problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One solution to validating both input and output would have been to create
 JSON schemas
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://json-schema.org/"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

 for each transformation.
 This kind of verification can easily be automated, and it will help any
 future changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Code reuse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of the code written in shell scripts, both Bash and jq code, is duplicated
 between files.
 While common functionality suitable for pipelining have been broken out,
 shared functions have not.
 Bash provides the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
source
\end_layout

\end_inset

 command for sharing functionality.
 Code sharing in jq through the use of modules and packages is still under
 development, but there is a way to load a single external command file.
 This file can be precomposed externally by concatenating files with function
 definitions first, and the actual usage of those functions second.
 The improvement was postponed due to the relative little reuse in early
 scripting and bright outlook on modules and packages support.
 As the number of scripts grew, code sharing/composition possibilities grew
 as well -- and with them possible improvements in development speed, consistenc
y and correctness.
 At this stage, software stability is more important for the final dataset
 download and analysis, and code refactoring can only be postponed.
 Foreseeing a greater reuse of JSON and jq tools, a separate open source
 project has been started -- jq-hopkok

 Many functions and utilities local to har-dulcify are project-agnostic,
 and thus suitable objects to move to jq-hopkok for ease composition.

Implement public suffix rules, use non-ICANN suffixes
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Implement-public-suffix-rules-use-non-ICANN-suffixes"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As datasets have been analyzed, public suffix rules have proven to work
 in general, with co.uk and similar second level domains being properly grouped
 and primary domains extracted.
 There are still traces of the wildcard rules 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sub:Public-suffix-list"

\end_inset

 in the data though, which means that while numbers are low, there are domains
 for which the public suffix rules have not been properly applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other potential improvements would be implementing the non-ICANN, private
 suffixes.
 This would for example lower the aggregate numbers for cloudfront.net and
 amazonaws.com as primary domains in the aggregates, focusing on the fact
 that subdomains belongs to different organizations.
 Disconnect's dataset, which lists cloudfront.net as a single tracker entity
 would still present Amazon as a the single tracking organization behind
 the domain though, which might be a bit misleading.
 It is true that they can read traffic data in the same way other web hosting
 and cloud services host can read traffic data to their customers, but customers
' common domain name suffix has little to do with it.

\begin_layout Subsection
Separating analysis steps
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Separating-analysis-steps"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As some of the analysis relies on aggregate numbers, such as domain and
 requests counts, they expect the entire dataset to be available at the
 start of the analysis.
 Saving these numbers in an intermediate step would allow further dataset
 refinement without having to perform the same filtering multiple times,
 and thus ease second-level filtering.
 Custom data questions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sub:Questions"

\end_inset

 are one example, as they need to carry the number of (non-failed) domains
 throughout the calculations, even though only a small subset of the data
 is interesting, in order to present them as part of the output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another example is the current analysis split into unfiltered and non-failed
 domains, which then is further split into unfiltered, internal and external
 resources 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sub:aggregate/analysis.sh"

\end_inset

.
 If the first step had been made as a separate filtering step instead of
 an integrated part, further analysis would have been clearer as well as
 easier to modularize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Saving the intermediate filtering results would simplify selecting for example
 non-failed domains which only use secure resources 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Insecure-versus-secure-resources"

\end_inset

, to look at their usage of internal/external/tracker usage compared to
 insecure domains 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Internal-versus-external"

\end_inset

.
 While redirects have been analyzed to some extent 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:HTTP,-HTTPS-and-redirects"

\end_inset

, another interesting idea would be to select domains with redirects 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:HTTP-status-codes"

\end_inset

 and perhaps consume the redirects -- especially from secure domain variations
 looking at secure redirects -- before performing further analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dynamic grouping, domain selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The har-heedless software was built to download domains based on a simple
 list, put them in folders per list and list variation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Dataset-variations"

\end_inset

 and then har-dulcify use the most recent HAR data to perform the aggregate
 analysis for the entire dataset.
 The overlap between different domain lists have been downloaded multiple
 times, and each round of downloads have started from zero to be sure that
 the domain list results represent a specific point in time.
 It would be beneficial to download each unique domain once then select
 domains as belonging to a specific analysis group, currently represented
 by domain lists, after they have been downloaded.
 This would allow a more dynamic grouping, and possibly re-arranging of
 domains to enable more interesting second-level analysis.

Similarity selection -- allowing a selection of domains to be the basis
 of finding similar domains.
 Similarities could be based on number of HTTP requests, specific external
 service usage or even individual unique IDs in query strings for services
 such as Google Analytics and Google AdWords.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Incremental adding and updating of domains
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another improvement would be to ensure that all data mapping steps are built
 in such a way that a single domain can be excluded or included from the
 results.
 This would enable single domains to be updated, perhaps as part of continuous
 analysis or from user input 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Creating-an-information-web-site"

\end_inset

, without having to recalculate all steps for the entire dataset results.
 While most incremental updates are a matter of easy addition and subtraction,
 some late analysis steps introduce coverage calculations and other arithmetical
 divisions, which may cause some data/precision loss if reversed.
 If these data reductions can be deferred to a separate mapping step, computing
 time might be acceptable.

P3P is a way for websites to declare their policies and intentions for data
 collected from web users.
 It is declared in a machine-readable format, as an XML file and in a compact
 encoding as an HTTP header.
 W3C's work started in 1997 and P3P 1.0 became a W3C recommendation in 2002.
 It never gained enough momentum and the work with P3P 1.1 was suspended
 in 2006.
 P3P is still implemented by many websites, even though it may not follow
 the originally intended usage.

In conversations with Dwight Hunter, privacy policy researcher, he mentioned

 Thesis data shows that this is not always true; there are policy-wise useless
 P3P headers being sent from some webpages, most probably to bypass Internet
 Explorer's (not all versions) strict cookie rules for third-party site
 without a P3P HTTP header.
 This has been highlighted by Microsoft in 2012, pointing at Google's P3P
 use.

\begin_layout Quotation
By default, IE blocks third-party cookies unless the site presents a P3P
 Compact Policy Statement indicating how the site will use the cookie and
 that the site’s use does not include tracking the user.
 Google’s P3P policy causes Internet Explorer to accept Google’s cookies
 even though the policy does not state Google’s intent.

Apart from ICANN domains, which have been implemented, there are also private
 domains considered public suffixes listed as rules.
 They are domains which have subdomains controlled by users/customers, for
 example joelpurra.github.io which is controlled by me but hosted by the code
 hosting service github.com.
 Other examples include cloud hosting/CDN services such as cloudfront.net,
 amazonaws.com, azurewebsites.net, fastly.net, herokuapp.com, blogs from several
 blogspot.TLD domains and dyndns.com's wide choice of dynamic domains.
 One example that looks like a technical choice in order to hinder accidental

 being (presumably) completely under Google's control.

 strings in HTML and CSS.
 It had proven hard to maintain, and the software project was abandoned
 before the thesis was started, but had not yet been replaced.
 In order to better handle the dynamic nature of modern web pages, the headless
 browser phantomjs

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many of the external resources will be overlapping between websites and
 domains, and downloading them multiple times can be avoided by caching
 the file the first time in a run.
 Keeping cached content would, depending on per-response cache settings
 and timeout, result in a different HTTP request and potentially different
 response.
 A file that has not changed on the server would generate an HTTP response
 status of 304 with no data, saving bandwidth and lowering transfer delays,
 where a changed file would generate a status 200 response with the latest
 version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the technologies in determining if a locally cached file is the correct/l
atest version includes the HTTP

, which is a string representation of a URL/file at a certain version.
 When content is transferred it may have an 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 is saved.
 Subsequent requests for the same, cached URL contain the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 -- and the server uses it to determine if a compact 304 response is enough
 or a full 200 response is necessary.
 It has been found that the

Flash files

\begin_layout Standard
Flash is a scriptable proprietary cross-platform vector based web technology
 owned by Adobe.
 Several kinds of content, including video players, games and ads, use Flash
 because it has historically been better suited than javascript for in-browser
 moving graphics and video.
 Flash usage has not been considered for this thesis as the technology isn
 not available on all popular web browsing platforms, notably Apple's iPad,
 and is being phased out by HTML 5 features such as

 emerged.
 One concern is whether or not script concatenation on a web page would
 affect script analysis at a later stage, by reducing the number of third-party
 requests.
 While it is hard to analyze all scripts, based on their wide spread use,
 third-party scripts stay on their respective home servers as software as
 a service (SaaS) to enable faster update cycles and tracking of HTTP requests.

\begin_layout Standard
Automated web spider/bot software can bring a significant load to a web
 server, as the spidering speed can exceed user browsing speed by far --
 a single web spider can potentially request thousands of pages in the span
 of minutes, effectively being a denial of service attack 
\begin_inset Note Greyedout
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Insert link to DoS information.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 on an underpowered server.
 Some sites also have information considered sensitive to being available
 for spiders, or even for certain (kinds) of spiders such as image spiders.
 The choice to not serve spiders can stem from technical reasons (bandwidth,
 server load), to privacy (do not allow information to be indexed in search
 engines) and business (do not allow data to be collected and aggregated).
 In order to instruct web spiders not to get certain kind of material, there
 are two basic mechanisms -- the special 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
robots.txt
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file and the HTML header tag
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
<meta name="robots" />
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Both can contain instructions for certain bots not to index certain paths
 or pages, or not to follow further links stemming from a page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commercial software from search engines, information collectors and other
 software vendors take these explicit wishes from webmasters into consideration,
 but har-heedless has not.
 While it is automated software, it is not spidering software requesting
 many pages, following links to explore the site -- it only accesses the
 front page of a domain, and resources explicitly requested by that one
 page.
 Information is not retrieved for indexing as such, as only HTTP request
 metadata is recorded.
 While some information requested to be not indexed might end up in the
 screenshots, they are kept in a format hard to re-parse for machines as
 non-public thesis data used for verification.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of the time spent downloading a web page is spent waiting for network
 resources, especially during timeouts during retrieval.
 To speed up downloading large amounts of web pages, parallelizing was employed
 using simple scripting techniques, starting multiple processes at once
 in batches, waiting for each batch to finish before starting the next.
 This was deemed inefficient, as the download and rendering speed of the
 slowest web page would be a bottle neck.
 In a later script versions, GNU 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 was used, with a setting to not start more jobs if the current CPU/system
 load was too high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During initial parallelizing tests, the laptop machine was shown to be able
 to handle 100 domain downloads in parallel, but this was later scaled down
 to ensure system overload would not affect results, at the cost of significantl
y longer download times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Screen size
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When phantomjs is running, it emulates having a browser window by keeping
 an internal graphics buffer.
 Even if web page is not rendered and shown on screen, it still has a screen
 size, which affects layout.
 With a bit of javascript or responsive CSS, the screen size can affect
 downloaded resources.
 Javascript can be used to delay download of images and other resources
 that are 
\emph on
below the fold
\emph default
, meaning outside of the initial view the user has without scrolling in
 any direction, as a page speed improvement.
 Responsive CSS adapts the page style to the screen size in order to increase
 usability for mobiles and other handheld devices, and might optimize the
 quality of downloaded images to match the screen size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, phantomjs uses the physical computer's primary screen size.
 In order to reduce differences between the laptop and server machines,
 a fixed emulated window size of 1024x768 pixels was chosen.
 The basis for this is that 1024x768 pixel resolution screens have been
 the recommended screen size to design for

Scripted browser scrolling (vertically) through the page has not been performed,
 thus javascript scrolling events triggering for example downloading of

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Screenshots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to visually being able to confirm that web pages have been downloaded
 correctly, a PNG screenshot can optionally be taken when the page has finished
 downloading.
 There is a processing cost associated with taking screenshots; it takes
 time for phantomjs to render the internal buffer as an image, convert it
 to base64 encoding for the augmented HAR data, jq to extract the image
 data, the system to convert the data back to binary and finally write it
 to disk.
 Extra processing is also needed to remove the screenshot from the augmented
 HAR file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The emulated browser window size also sets a limit on the screenshot size
 when rendered, but the entire browser canvas is captured.
 This means that screenshots that are saved to disk in most cases extend
 beyond the viewport size, most often vertically; this corresponds to scrolling
 through the entire page.

\begin_layout Standard
System load has been shown to vary greatly based on the type of request,
 mainly differing by HTTP and HTTPS response rates.
 High failure rates mean a lot of time is spent waiting until a set time
 limit/timeout has been reached.
 Increasing the upper bound on parallelism and instead dynamically adjusting
 the number of concurrent requests emphasizing system load should decrease
 time needed to download a set of domains with a large failure rate (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Failed-versus-non-failed"

\end_inset

).
 Time limits can also be adjusted based on previous dataset results' actual
 reply timings found in HAR data, instead of setting a high and

Some websites are not downloaded successfully, for different reasons.
 The DNS settings might not be correct, the server may be shut down, there

 Unfortunately, outside of local software errors which may result in parseable

 so, an automated analysis may include false negatives because of remote
 system automated request countermeasures.

\begin_layout Standard
Requested URL counts can skew aggregate results if a single domains makes
 an excessive amount of requests to a certain URL/domain/tracker or in a
 certain classification.

 the classification, gives the possibility to calculate coverage per domain
 later on.

 A good alternative for such servers is phantomjs, which is built as a command

 of scripts.
 One such example script included in the default installation generates
 HAR files from a webpage visit.

While there are command line tools to transform data in for example plain

 One such tool gaining momentum is jq, which is implemented with a domain

 The DSL is based around a set of filters, similar to pipes in the Unix
 world, transforming the input and passing it on to the next stage.
 jq performs well with large datasets, as it treats data as a stream where
 each top-level object is treated separately.

At the time of writing, jq is released as version 1.4.
 Support for regular expressions is planned for version 1.5, which has been
 in the making for the duration of the thesis.
 As the thesis code is run on multiple machines/systems and expected to
 deliver the same results, using standardized packages has been a part of
 ensuring that.

Extract data from HTTP Archive (HAR) files for an aggregate analysis.
 HAR files by themselves contain too much data, so the relevant parts need
 to be extracted.
 The extracted parts are then broken down into smaller parts that are easier
 to group and analyze, and added to the data alongside the original.
 With the expanded data in place, requests are classified by basic measures
 and matched against external datasets.
 Scripts are written to perform only a limited task and instead be chained
 together by piping the data between them.
 As the scripts generally connect in only one way, the convenience scripts
 in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 While the top lists and curated lists are assumed to primarily contain
 sites with staff or enthusiasts to take care of them and make sure they
 are available and functioning, the domain lists randomly extracted from
 TLD zones might not.
 Results below seem to fall into groups of non-random and randomly selected

 Non-random domains have a failure rate of below 15% for HTTP, and 70-90%
 for HTTPS, meaning that 30-10% implement HTTPS.
 Random zone domains have a failure rate of above 20% for HTTP and above
 99% for HTTPS.

\begin_layout Standard
The very low HTTPS adoption rates among random sites is both surprising
 and not surprising -- while larger sites might have felt the pressure to
 implement them, a non-professional site owner might see it as both an unnecessa
ry technical challenge and an unnecessary additional cost.
 Most X.509 public key infrastructure (PKI)

 certificates cost money to buy and install.
 With public IPv4 addresses running out and legacy browsers requiring one
 IP-address per HTTPS certificate, it can also lead to an additional fee
 for renting an exclusive IP-address.
 The random zone domains responding to HTTPS requests exhibit behavior more
 similar to top and curated sites -- see how dataset variation lines follow
 each other in Figure

 A higher domain response rate means a higher risk of a crash; larger datasets
 have crashes in 0.25-2.5% of domains.
 Most crashes were observed to be caused by malformed image data triggering
 an uncaught software exception in the JPEG image decoder used by phantomjs.
 Looking at the resulting HAR files means that both local software errors
 and remote errors are considered failures.
 The analysis can be improved with additional testing and improvements to
 phantomjs; missing HAR files have been ignored in further analyses.

\begin_layout Standard
Choosing the term non-failed instead of successful when it comes to dividing
 and focusing result discussions has its basis in the HTTP standard, which
 defines a status code.
 Successful requests are generally shown with an HTTP status code of 200
 (actually the entire 2xx group), or a 304 which means that a previously
 cached (presumably successful) result is still valid.
 Many sites respond with a 3xx status, which is not exactly successful as
 it does not contain actual content, but can not be considered a failure
 as it will most likely lead to another resource that is successful.
 While a status response of 4xx or 5xx shows there is a problem of some
 kind, for the purpose of this thesis a response that contains any HTTP
 status number is still considered a non-failure, as the remote system has
 responded with a proper HTTP response parseable by phantomjs and har-heedless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The majority of domains domains are responding to HTTP requests during domain
 scanning, but many do not either by configuration or chance.
 While most non-failed domains produce 2xx responses, there is a high ratio
 of 3xx redirect class responses.
 With some 20% of random domains and around 50% of top sites redirecting
 their visitors, it begs further research.
 Many of them are 301, considered permanent, redirects; they indicate that
 the information supposedly found at the domain is actually found somewhere
 else.
 The difference between http and http-www datasets seems to suggest that
 redirects lead to the other (above 90%), or a secure variant; this thesis
 has looked at redirects within the same domain and to HTTPS variations

\begin_layout Standard
The table shows non-failed origin domains having requests strictly to the
 same domain, subdomains, superdomains or same primary domain -- jointly
 known as internal domains -- or external (non-internal) domains.
 Origin domains that are not exclusively loading from either internal or
 external resources are loading from mixed domains.
 See also Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More detailed examples of distributions of resources are shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Cumulative-distribution-ratio-internal-resources"

\end_inset

, with ratio of internal resources per domain (as opposed to external resources)
 on the x axis, and what cumulative ratio of domains exhibit this property
 on the y axis.
 The leftmost marker in each dataset shows the ratio of domains (y axis)
 with 0% internal (strictly external) resources and the right hand marker
 99% internal resources.
 To the right of the 99% marker are domains using strictly internal resources;
 the vertical difference (y axis) between the two markers shows the ratio
 of mixed resource usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mixing resources from both internal and external domains is the most common
 way to compose a web page for datasets not randomly chosen from zones,
 although it is quite common for random domains as well.
 They do show relatively high tendencies to either extreme, with only either
 internal or external resources; in addition the usage of external resources
 is lower in HTTPS variations.
 As can be noted in both Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:internal-mixed-external-resources"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Cumulative-distribution-ratio-internal-resources"

\end_inset

, the top domains are very similar in terms of resource distribution between
 HTTP and HTTPS datasets.
 This means that active tracking on top sites is as prevalent when surfing
 a website over a secure, encrypted connection as on an insecure.
 Random .dk sites has the highest ratio of internal resources, but even so
 more than two thirds of domains load external resources.
 Strictly external plus mixed resource usage is above 80% in most and 90%
 in many datasets.
 The same is true for for HTTPS, confirming the thesis' hypotheses that
 tracking is installed through the use of external resources, deliberately
 or not, on HTTPS sites as well

 Further analysis showing internal/external ratios are generally calculated
 per domain which has at least one internal/external request.
 This makes a rather large difference for random zone domains, which have
 a rather high ratio of domains with no internal or no external resources

Looking at internal versus external domains, with regards to the origin
 domain, is easy to do as it is only a matter of string comparison.
 The next step would be to use organization grouping, as seen in the Disconnect
 classifications

.
 While it requires more extensive reverse requests' domain usage mapping
 work to detect private CDN domains plus manual classification work, and
 might only be effective for top organizations with many services, it adds
 to seeing legal entities as information receivers rather than the merely
 technical domain partitioning.
 It also adds more questions -- could for example a private CDN domain hosted
 in another organization's datacenter be seen as both internal and external?

\begin_layout Standard
Using HTTPS to secure the connection between site and site users is considered
 an effective way to avoid prying eyes on the otherwise technically quite
 open and insecure internet.
 Sites which handle sensitive information, such as e-commerce shops, online
 payment providers and of course banks often tout being secure to use --
 and they have strong financial incentives to provide a service that is
 (or at least comes across as) trustworthy.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 As browsers will warn users if a site secured with HTTPS loads resources
 over non-HTTPS connections, site developers will have to make sure each
 and every request is secure to avoid being labeled not trustworthy.
 This also applies to third-party services, which have to make sure to provide
 HTTPS in order to be able to continue providing services to sites making
 the switch to a fully secured experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the concerns with mixing in HTTP on an HTTPS site is that an attacker
 can use traffic sniffers to get a hold of sensitive information leaking
 out through HTTP, or man in the middle attacks on several kinds of resources
 to insert malicious code, even though the site is supposed to be protected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following table shows to what extent sites manage to take full advantage
 of HTTPS, and to which extent they fail in requesting either internal or
 external resources.
 Note that HTTP domains that redirect to HTTPS 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:HTTP,-HTTPS-and-redirects"

\end_inset

 right away and/or only load HTTPS resources are shown as fully secure,
 as the analysis excludes the origin request -- although in general an initial
 request to HTTP can potentially nullify all subsequent security measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:secure-mixed-insecure-resources"

\end_inset

 shows an overview of ratio of domains with strictly secure requests, mixed
 security or strictly secure requests (x axis) per dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the technology has been around a long time, it does not seem as if
 very many sites actually use HTTPS on their sites.
 Even origin sites that respond to HTTPS requests seem to either redirect
 to an HTTP site 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:HTTP,-HTTPS-and-redirects"

\end_inset

, or load at least some of its resources over non-HTTPS connections.
 Typing in an HTTPS address into the browser's address bar will actually
 only give full HTTPS security on 27-58% of the domains -- a number where
 the random domains surprisingly beat the non-random ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cumulative distribution of domains (y axis) with a certain ratio of
 secure resources (out of all requested resources) per domain (x axis) is
 shown on in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Cumulative-distribution-ratio-secure-resources"

\end_inset

.
 The first marker in each dataset shows the ratio of domains with no secure
 resources at all.
 The second marker shows 99% secure resources, which marks the start of
 fully secure domains.
 The vertical differences between the two markers for each dataset shows
 the range of sites with mixed security.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can see that HTTPS datasets have much better security than their HTTP
 counterparts.
 Looking at se.2014-07-10.random.100000-http-www which has over 60% completely
 insecure domains, 30% mixed security and less than 10% domains with only
 secure resources.
 Comparing it with se.2014-07-10.random.100000-https-www, we see that it has
 less than 10% completely insecure domains, a bit more than 30% mixed security
 and over 55% domains with only secure resources.
 The ratios of completely insecure and completely secure domains have almost
 been reversed.
 We can also see that many domains in the HTTPS datasets have between 90%
 and 99% secure resources -- around 25% of municipalities for example --
 which seems like a relatively small gap to close to get a completely secure
 site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is adoption lower for top sites? As high-traffic sites they might have
 a high system load, and since HTTPS require some extra processing and data
 exchange, they might have deferred it until the security is 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 needed -- such as when passwords of financial information is entered.
 Strict HTTPS performance concerns were dismissed by Google engineers in
 2010

 Show next is the ratio of redirected domains making strictly internal or

 The same goes for insecure, secure and mixed security redirects -- plus

 An additional mark shows the percentage of final secure redirects with
 an 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_inset

, as not all mixed redirects lead to secure sites -- sometimes they lead
 back to an insecure site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most domains that redirect make a single redirect, but every few sites make
 more than one; the average is around 1.23 redirects.
 With 49-71% of top sites in the HTTP variations redirecting, but only 30-36%
 of HTTP-www variations redirecting, it seems that the www subdomain still
 is in use, rather than not using any subdomain.
 For random domains numbers are a bit more even, with 24-31% of both HTTP
 and HTTP-www variations redirecting.
 More detailed data than in the below table clearly shows that domains generally
 pick either www or no subdomain, and redirect from one to the other; the
 www subdomain is most common as the final destination, especially for HTTPS
 variations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A difference between top and random domains, is that top domains keep their
 redirects mostly internal, while random domains redirect elsewhere.
 Curated sites are in between, with a portion of HTTP-www variations redirecting
 externally.
 This seems to suggest that top sites has contents, while random domains
 to a larger extent do not -- 39-60% of redirected domains end up being
 aliases for another domain than a user would have typed in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When it comes to security, it is no surprise to see HTTP variations redirect
 mostly to other insecure URLs.
 The extent of domains implementing HTTPS but then redirecting to HTTP is
 more surprising -- only in 23-35% of top sites will let you stay on a fully
 secure connection -- and that number excludes mixed resource security in
 later stages of the browsing experience 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Insecure-versus-secure-resources"

\end_inset

.
 An additional few percent of HTTPS domains even mix security usage during
 redirects and take a 
\emph on
detour
\emph default
 over an insecure URL in the process of redirecting the user to the final,
 secure destination -- meaning that even if you type in a secure address
 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 end up on a secure address, you may have passed through something completely
 insecure along the way.
 While this might be considered a corner case, it nullifies some of the
 security measures put in place by HTTPS, and could leak for example a carelessl
y set session identifier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here it is a surprise to see that financial institutions in the 
\emph on
.SE Health Status
\emph default
 domain lists do not take advantage of HTTPS, by redirecting users entering
 through HTTP -- at less than 20% fully secured redirects and a surprising
 ratio of mixed redirects, they are at about the same level as general Swedish
 top sites.
 Even more surprising is that they even elect to redirect users away from
 HTTPS enabled pages to insecure variants in 60% of HTTPS-www domains.
 Counties, higher education and media are worse yet -- all make no effort
 in redirecting users from HTTP to HTTPS.

 An additional reason might be adoption of HTML5 and client side javascript

Resources served from external URLs may well come from other public suffixes;
 here they have been grouped by TLD.
 The connections between datasets and TLDs is interesting; .se datasets load
 more from .se domains than others, and the equivalent is valid for .dk datasets.
 We can also see that despite Alexa's top

 from .se domains.
 This points towards those sites being aware of the country of origin for

The 
\emph on
.SE Health Status'

 media category has over 40 tracker requests on average -- the highest number
 of tracker requests per domain, much higher than for example public authorities
 and random zone domains at 5-7, with top domains having 17-32 requests
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Request-counts"

\end_inset

.
 What is more interesting than request counts is the number of tracker organizat
ions per domain -- while more information may be leaked as the number of
 requests to an organization increase, the same amount could potentially
 leak through with just one or two carefully composed requests to each organizat
ion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is hard to compare Disconnect's organizations' coverage across
 datasets as the number of domains increases the chance of additional organizati

 -- more than

 organizations.
 Looking at Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Organizations-per-domain"

\end_inset

 we see that top sites have requests to more organizations than random domains
 do.
 Over 40% of random .se HTTP-www domains have no known trackers, about as
 many have share some information with one tracker and the top 1% have six
 or more.
 This is compared to 32% of Alexa's top site sharing information with more
 than five organizations, 10% have 13 or more, and 1% share information
 with at least 48 organizations.
 There are even a couple of domains among the Alexa sites which have more
 than 75 recognized tracker organizations just on the front page -- a clear
 example of how it is impossible to tell where your browsing habits can
 end up, and even more so how it is used in a second stage.
 It is also clear that the non-zone domains have as much tracking on when
 using a secure connection as on an insecure connection, while the difference
 for zone domains can be explained by the very low HTTPS usage

 While it is clear that Amazon can analyze and use traffic information from
 hosted services, the data itself can be assumed to belong to the hosted
 organizations.
 This is a strong reason why the domain is listed as content in Disconnect's
 blocking list -- because of the variety of services being hosted on subdomains,
 it cannot be blocked as for example advertisement even if it is being hosted
 there.
 It can be seen as a flaw in the Disconnect way of blocking, even though
 listing individual subdomains in other categories might be a way to override
 the content bypass -- but as these non-branded domains can be seen as throw-awa
y domains, it can become a game of cat and mouse

 The reason given to site owners using Google Analytics is that the DoubleClick
 tracker offers implementors additional rich audience information such as
 age, gender and interests on top of their current technical analysis from
 Google Analytics.
 The underlying reason is possibly that Google wants DoubleClick, which
 brings a lot of income, to have greater coverage across websites -- greater
 coverage meaning more and higher quality visitor information.

Disconnect's categories and their coverage across different datasets are
 shown in the table below, as well as the coverage of domains where any
 (at least one) external resource matches Disconnect's blocking list.
 As mentioned earlier, the special Disconnect category contains major Facebook,
 Google and Twitter domains -- domains which could also have been listed
 as advertising, analytics or social domains 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sub:Disconnect-category"

\end_inset

.
 The content category, which bypasses Disconnect's blocking by default,
 can for this reason be seen as the most accurate in terms of coverage,
 as domains have presumably been added as content in a manual process of
 whitelisting

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows each category's coverage (x axis) per dataset.
 The grey bar in the background shows ratio of domains with any (at least
 one) external request matching Disconnect's blocking list for each dataset;
 it effectively shows the union of the coverage of all categories per domain.
 In some cases a single category has the same coverage as the union.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The highest coverage being connected with the Disconnect category explains
 the low coverage of advertising, analytics and social.
 If, for example, the two domains facebook.com and twitter.com would be included
 in the social category, coverage would be 35-56% percentage points higher
 for top domains and 9-11% percentage points higher for random domains 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sub:Top-domains-General"

\end_inset

 -- and more accurate.
 The same goes for advertising and doubleclick.net (30-50%, 7-36%) and analytics
 and google-analytics.com (63-76%, 24-32%) 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sub:Top-domains-Google"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is surprising is the high coverage of content from known trackers.
 While the Disconnect category has the highest coverage overall, the content
 category is the second largest -- significantly larger than the advertising,
 analytics and social categories in most datasets.
 While a large portion of this is due to extensive usage of Google's hosted
 services 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sub:Top-domains-Google"

\end_inset

, all organizations with only content domains as well as those with

 domains (Table

) are let through to 67-78% of top domains and 38-56% or random domains.
 Mixing advertisement, or in this case tracking in general, with content
 has previously been discussed as way for organizations to avoid in-browser
 blocking

 the Disconnect blocking list used for matching can easily be replaced with

 This also opens up the possibility of using a locally modified blocking

 advertising, analytics or social.

Google is very popular with all Alexa and most Swedish curated datasets
 have a coverage above 80% -- and many closer to 90%.
 Random domains have a lower reliance on Google at 47-62% -- still about
 half of all domains.
 Apart from the .SE Health Status list of Swedish media domains, Facebook
 doesn't reach 40% in top or curated domains.
 Facebook coverage on random zone domains is 6-10%, which is also much lower
 than Google's numbers.
 Twitter generally has even lower coverage, at about half of that of Facebook
 on average.
 As can be seen, Google alone oftentimes has a coverage higher than the
 domains in the Disconnect category -- it shows that Google's content domains
 are in use
